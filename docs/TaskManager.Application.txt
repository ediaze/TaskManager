Common Password Rules
===============================================================================
Here are some standard rules you might consider enforcing for password validity:
* Minimum Length: Typically, a minimum of 8 characters is recommended.
* Maximum Length: Set a reasonable maximum length to protect against very long input (e.g., 100 characters).
* Character Types: Require a mix of different character types, such as:
  Lowercase letters (a-z)
  Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  Numbers (0-9)
  Special characters (e.g., !@#$%^&*)
* No Common Passwords: Disallow passwords from a list of common passwords, which are easily guessable.
* No Personal Information: Avoid allowing passwords that contain easily accessible personal information, like the user's own name or username.

Example Passwords and Validation Results
* Valid Passwords: 
  "StrongP@ssw0rd!" (meets all criteria)
* Invalid Password: 
  "password" (no uppercase, numbers, or special characters)
  "12345678" (only numbers, no letters or special characters)
  "Short1!" (less than 8 characters)
